        <p> Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened
            dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then
            cooked by
            boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to
            yield
            a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.

<h2 id= "directions"> Directions </h2>
<li> In a medium sized bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the flour, add the slightly beaten egg, and mix. Mixture
should form a stiff dough. If needed, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water.</li>
<li> On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for about 3 to 4 minutes. With a pasta machine or by hand roll dough out to
desired thinness. Use machine or knife to cut into strips of desired width.</li>
